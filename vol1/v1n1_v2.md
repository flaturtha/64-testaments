## INCIDENT AT THE LONDON MUSUEM

***
CURATOR OF THE NEW SCYTHIAN EXHIBIT FOUND BRUTALLY MURDERED IN HIS OWN EXHIBIT
Police suspect rival expert Colonel Aloysius Krill

On the evening of Sunday, August 28, 2054, police responded to alarms at the British Museum in London. Upon arrival, they found Sir Godfrey Markum-Dunn, reknowed expert on ancient religions and specialist in the Scythian people of the Middle East and southern Russian steppes. Standing over his mutilated body was one Col. Krill, unknown to this reporter but reportedly in a heated disput with the deceased over provedence of artifacts.

The deep voice richoted off the hard granite walls and floors of the museum and seemed to echo forever. Between bellows, the only other sound was the hard *clop-clop* of his hard-soled boots on the stone floor.

The voice came again. “Damn you, Godfrey! What in the name of all that is holy do you think this accomplishes. I knew you were a damned idiot the moment I heard your lecture of the origins of the Indra myth. Utter rot, you cad.”

A pause and the *clop-clop* echoed. Then ...

“Where in the bloody, blue blazes are you, man? Speak up for yourself. Quit hiding in the shadows and face me, you rotter!”

He stopped and stroked his great walrus mustache and *hrumphed* before striding off in a new direction.

Sir Godfrey was running through the hallways of the museum. But it wasn’t the man with the walrus mustache that he ran from. Behind him loped a shadow ... panting, huffing and the sound of nails clicking on the hard granite floors of the great museum. The moonlight through the high windows of the exhibit halls captured the creature as it loped past and cast a shadow darker than the rest against the cases and cabinets the held antiquity. 

But the shadow was formless. Long limbs stretched across the great rooms; a head, mouth open grew and streaked across the walls. Even in the light of the moon shining through the great windows, only darkness.

And the smell of wet fur.

The squat little man hurried along a hallway between exhibit rooms, his hands fumbling with a ring of keys. He dropped them once and kicked them across the floor. The sound seemed to boom and echo and Sir Godfrey scurried after them, glancing over his shoulder.

Somewhere behind him in the darkness of the museum, the sound like a half bark and half growl. Ahead of him, but down a side hallway, the angry voie of the mustached man cursed him with a string of epithets.

Sir Godfrey grasped the keys in his hand and dashed into the next exhibit hall, nearly knocking over a mannequin dressed in a Scythian soldier’s meager armor. The spear held, no, leaned against the mannequin’s hand spun away and its iron tip smashed the glass of a nearby display case. Sir Godfrey didn’t appear to notice and skittered on across the room to a small display case at the rear of the room.
