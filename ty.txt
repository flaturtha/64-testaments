**Want to get 8 novellas (the entire 1st volume of THE 64 TESTAMENTS OF KRILL) for just $1?**

*(offer only available on this page … once you click away, this offer is gone forever!)*

For just $1 today, you’ll get the entire 1st volume of the entire Krill saga (64 novellas in 8 volumes of 8 novellas each) delivered in your preferred ebook format (Kindle or ePub).

::**That’s 8 novellas for $1!**::
*(each novella is ~30,000 words or approximately a 3 hour read so that’s a full 24 hours reading for $1!)*

Normally, each novella will sell for between $2.99 – $4.99 (depending on sales, promotions, etc.). You’ll get 8 for less than 1/3 the price of a single story. *$1 vs. as much as $39.92 … a 97.49% discount.*

**So what’s the catch?**

I know, it sounds like a too-good-to-be-true deal. Why would I give up so much cash? Lose $38 and change every time someone like you takes advantage of this deal?

I’ll be honest … I’m a new author (although I’ve been writing under other pseudonyms for more than 20 years) and want to introduce my stories and characters to readers like you.

I get it … it’s one thing to download a free short story. It’s another thing to commit to spending your cash on an unknown author and unknown story.

So, I’m willing to take the hit on my income in order to give you a chance to find a new series you’ll love. And I’m certain you will!

**In fact, I guarantee it.** Spend a buck today, get all 8 novellas as they’re released (actually *before* they’re officially released!) and read them. 

Don’t love ‘em? Just send me an email and I’ll refund not just the dollar you spent today, but the price of a full novella — I’ll refund you $4.99 that you can spend on another author’s book or a cup of coffee … your choice!

All I’ll ask (and it’s just a request, not a refund requirement) is that you fill out a short survey and tell me what didn’t work for you. Hey, I want to improve so others can enjoy my stories!
