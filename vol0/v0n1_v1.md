CHAPTER 1 --- THE TEMPLE OF KU' RANISH


Northern India --- 1901

Even in the darkness of the jungle night, the air hung with a sickly heat and echoed with the sounds of monkeys calling out to one another, bugs skittering and clacking their own calls of danger and sexual attraction.

In the distance, a sound. At first, it seemed miles away. Then it grew louder, closer. It was the sound of a rushing river, a waterfall crashing onto rocks, a foul wind ripping through the trees. The sound grew until it overcame the howls of the monkeys and the chattering of the insects. It became a scream.

The scream of a man. A man in pain, in terror.

Then silence. A silence that hung in the air, no creature daring to call out. Then it came again. A deep, moaning scream.

The scream emanated from a temple built into the jungle itself, hune from massive stones of a cliff. Inside, the shimmering light of torches cast dancing shadows on the wall. The scream echoed off the hard, stone walls, then died away to be replaced by soft chants.

Inside a great room, twenty or so half naked brown skinned men in dashikis lay prostrate before a large stone dias. On top of the dias was another brown skinned man. 

He was also naked, except for the dashiki wrapped around his waist. On his head was a ragged turbin, it's furls in disarray. Sweat poured off his face and chest, which rose and fell as if searching for a sip of air.

Behind the dias stood a man over six feet tall. He wore a long, pure white robe and a turban of his own, emblazoned with a blood red ruby rested on the forehead and seemed to burn as the torchlight reflected on it.

The high priest stood with his head back, his arms raised, a Sikh dagger in his right hand, and chanted an ancient rite.

"[INSERT ANCIENT LANGUAGE LANGUAGE]"

The chant was a mere mumble, a rumble from deep in his chest. It consumed him and his body began to shake. His mumble became louder until it echoed from the stone walls of the chamber. 

Below, the prostrate men began to undulate in rhythm with the high priest's chant. They echoed his words and began to rise: first to their knees, then squatting. Arms raised, they turned their bloodshot eyes to the dias, the man laying on it, and the high priest chanting behind it.

Drums began to pound. Cymbals rattled. The minor-key song of a sitar.

The tempo grew faster. The sound louder. It grew from a mumble and a chatter to a crushing sound that seemed to tear at the very walls of the temple.

Then, it stopped. 

Utter silence.

Behind the dias, the high priest clasped his hands together around the dagger. Then man on the dias, held by some invisible hand, stared up at the glinting blade and screamed, but no sound came out of his mouth.

The high priest's eyes were closed. Then they fluttered open. He muttered a single word, then drove the dagger deep into the man's chest, dragging it downward to his stomach.

The squatting men in front of the dias leapt to their feet in a shout and the drums, cymbals, and sitar clamoured as if they had never stopped.

The high priest set the bloody dagger aside and reached into the man's chest, covering his hands with the bright red blood that oozed from the tear. With his finger, he made a small circle on the man's forehead.

Then he looked up over the men, once again prostate before him, and smiled.

“My children, it was written a thousand years ago that a great shadow will overwhelm our country and punish us for our sins if we did not turn to the true gods. We did not and for a century and a half, these devils have held sway upon everything.

“Until now, however, we, the true drujavena, have remained hidden. But the gods have revealed to me that it is no more.

“The white devils have begun a purge of all who fail to worship their gods or follow their corrupt ways. That purge is coming here.

“But fear not, my children, for though you may die in body, your eternal soul will be secured. And your sacrifice will awaken the true gods from their slumber, as it is foretold.

“And they will rise from their slumber, angered by the sacrilege that comes. Angered at your deaths. The gods will raise you once again to fight and rip open the heavens to make a gateway for our gods to leave their realm and conquer their enemies.

“When they come, you will rise again to rule over those who have rejected the true gods. You will be their masters.

“So go. Be not afraid of the white devil. Know that he brings death for that is what he is. But through this death, he will awaken the true gods!

“Form up, damn you! Get your bloody asses in line, you heathen lot.”

The voice bellowed commands across the jungle path as a troop of red-coated soldiers pushed through, slashing the low hanging vines and small brush to clear a way.

“Sir!” A voice up ahead.

“Sir, the temple.” A soldier ducked beneath a banana tree leave the size of an elephant’s ear and snapped to attention before the British Army Colonel.

“Colonel Krill, sir. We found the entrance to the temple. Just up ahead. About 100 yards.”

The grim-faced Colonel stroked his walrus mustache and adjusted his monocle. 

“Just ahead, you say? Jolly good” Turning to the troop behind him and sneering, “Dammit! Who told you to rest? You lazy lot! Lashes for every man not pushing through this damnedable jungle immediately. Move it, you lot!”

He swatted his swagger stick at the nearest soldier who winced and then plunged into the heavy undergrowth ahead. More soldiers followed, using their bayonets to slap away the heavy leaves and vines.

“Push ahead, lads. On to crush these heathen devil worshipers. No quarter. No quarter.” Krill sauntered forward as his men rushed past him in pairs.

***

Colonel Krill stood before the towering rock face and gazed at the light brown stone in the early morning light. The temple was hune from the stone itself, its inner sanctum carved from a natural cave. On both sides of the semi-natural entrance stood two massive stone guards. Their heads were elephantine, with human bodies. Massive tusks, a double pair on each side of the sneering mouth. In their clasped hands, they each held a pair of long, twisted kirpaan swords.

“Blood animals,” grunted the colonel. Then to his troop, “Attack, no mercy. No quarter given to heathen cultists.”

A shout in unison from one hundred men as they surged forward up the small slope from the jungle to the temple entrance, Col. Krill at the front.

The column of men rushed through the entrance and found itself in a large room, naturally lit from skylights in the ceiling high above. Before them stood a small group of half naked brown skinned men. None were armed. None moved.

Above and behind them stood another man, in full robes. As the troop entered the sanctum, the man smiled and raised his arms. He head back, he muttered unheard words.

“Spread out!” came the shout from the master sergeant. “Front line kneel. Prepare to fire.”

The men fanned out and lined up in two rows of ten men each. The front row knelt and raised their muskets. The line behind stood in the gaps between their counterparts and raised their muskets.

Before them, no more than twenty paces, the small group of half naked brown skinned supplicants stood, arms to their sides, faces empty, eyes passive.

Colonel Krill stepped passed his master sergeant and looked the gaggle of men before him and smiled a lopsided smile. Above them, the high priest still chanted, mumbling a prayer to his gods.

“Your gods will not save you, heathen. Surrender now and you will be executed swiftly. Resist and be damned!”

The high priest’s chant halted. He lowered his head and gazed at the small white man below him.

“Our gods are more powerful than you know, white man. They have already heard my prayer and will defend their priests. It is you who much surrender to the greater power of the Angra Mainu or be damned.”

The colonel’s back stiffened and straightened.

“Poppycock!” was all he said before swiveling on his heel and taking two firm steps back past his master sergeant.

Then to the sergeant, “Send these savages to hell!”

***

The huge stone sanctum echoed with the sounds of muskets, of the screams of men, of smoke. Again, the report of guns firing in unison overwelmed the order to fire. For a full minute, the explosions of the muskets bounced off the stone walls before they and the smoke clear enough to see.

Twenty half naked brown skinned man lay on the ground, a mass of bodies ripped apart by musket balls. Blood oozed from individuals and blended into one puddle that stained the white dashikis and turbans.

On the high stone dias, the high priest still stood, his eyes cold. 

“You have murdered the priests of dreguuant and committed a great sacrelige against the Amesha Spentas. But they will rise again. My priests will rise again, inhabited by the daevas themselves and take you and your men to eternal damnation.”

Krill once again stepped forward and slid his sword from its scabbard. Pointing it at the high priest, he said in a quiet voice, “Bring me that man.”

The troop, led by the master sergeant rushed forward with a scream, stepping on and over the dead men. They surged up the sides of the dias platform and convirged on the high priest. Hands grabbed him and pinned his arms. Boots kicked him; fists punched him. Epithets, curses, and course laughter pummeled him. He was dragged from his place beside the alter, down to where Col. Krill stood, and forced to kneel before the white man.

Col. Krill touched the tip of his sword to the priest’s chin and examined the man’s face. It was dark, filled with hate at the man who held his life. But proud. Unbending. His eyes burned red. Then seemed to shift to blue. The man smiled up at Col. Krill.

Behind him, Col. Krill’s men overturned the stone dias, smashed clay pots and overturned idols. They ripped the jewels from the eyes of the stone guardians and plundered the temple.

Col. Krill ignored their actions and kept his eye on his prisoner. He spoke again in a soft, almost whisper.

“You are the high priest of a forbidden cult. Renounce your devil worship and you will be spared.”

“Spared? By you? To what end? A life in your prison? A life as a slave? I am the Mobedan Mobed, high priest of the Amesha Spenta. Kill me if you wish; I will be restored by my gods. You and your men have committed sacrilege against my gods and will be punished.”

Col. Krill smiled as he drew back his sword. As he slashed out and down with his sword, severing the high priest’s head from his body, he simply said, “Your gods are nothing, heathen.”

Col. Krill stooped and picked up a tattered edge of a discarded turban and wiped the blood from his blade and slid it into its scabbard. He stood himself erect and watched his troops smashing and destroying the idols and sacred objects of the temple. And he smiled.

As he stepped over the headless body of the Mobedan Mobed, he stumbled, nearly loosing his balance as a tremor shook the room. Dust and pebbls fell from the ceiling. A wind, like the hot breath of the massive god-statue behind the alter, blew across the sanctum.

Dust and smoke swirled as more tremors shook the temple. Large stones fell from the ceiling and lightning crashed. Then silence again.

The body of the high priest, straddled by Col. Krill, shuddered then a fine mist swirled around it. It glowed as if errupting with fire from within. Then it turned pure white and turned to ash, falling in a pile on the ground at Col. Krill’s feet. 

Nothing moved. No sounds. Then ... a shriek from the great god-statue and the wind came again. It burned hot and fierce and swept away the ashes of the high priest’s body, swirling them upward into the mist the collected towards the ceiling.

The bodies of the half naked, brown skinned men rippled with electricity. Small blue arcs of lightning danced across their corpses.

Then, one by one, the corpses began to rise. To their knees; to their feet. They moved towards Col. Krill. Some turned and marched towards the troops, frozen in mid-debauche of destruction.

“Dear god in heaven,” was the only word spoken.

Then screams as the troops were grabbed by the risen dead. The troops slashed at the dead men with bayonets; smashed at them with their muskets but the dead men were unaffected as they reached out with bloody hands to grapple with the soldiers.

Screams of pain as flesh melted off the soldiers beneath the acrid touch of the dead supplicants. The troops ran, lept from the dias platform, but found themselves cut off from the exit by the reanimated dead.

Above the melee, a laugh. Deep, resonating, echoing thoughout the chamber. Col. Krill looked up and saw the Mobedan Mobed standing on the shoulder of the giant god-statue.

“You are cursed. The souls of your men belong to my masters.”

Col. Krill was frozen but only for a moment. With one swift action, he drew his sword and slashed at the nearest supplicant. The body crumbled but rose again, a great slash and blood across its stomach. But it kept moving, grabbing at panicked soldiers.

The Colonel crashed through the crowd of risen dead and bounded up the steps towards the god-statue. Sword still in his hand, he climbed, all the while cursing the high priest.

“You will die, you damned heathen filth. I’ll cut you down once and for all with my sword and cut you into tiny pieces.”

The high priest waited and smiled. As Col. Krill reached the folded arms of the god-statue, he reached down and grabbed the Colonel’s face in his ahands.

“[ANOTHER SLURRY OF ANCIENT LANGUAGE ... A CURSE ... THEN IN ENGLISH]”

Col. Krill struggled against the grip of the Mobedan Mobed and slashed upward with his sword. Then, a brilliant flash of white light. Then darkness.

***

A low moan broke the silence of the temple’s inner sanctum. In the darkness, it was impossible to tell where the sound came from. Then Col. Krill heard it again and realized he was the source of the sound.

He blinked his eyes and tried to pull himself upward. A searing pain, like a saber slash, cut through him. He felt his chest but while his uniform was wet with sweat, he felt to sticky blood.

He blinked again as his eyes adjusted to the darkeness. He was laying on the dias platform below the great god-statue. Around him lay the broken idols and sacred objects of the temple. But he was alone. No bodies, not even blood. 

He stood and felt the pain again. It nearly put him to his knees but he managed to get down the steps to the main floor, half limping, half falling. 

A light, dim and faint ... the light of the full moon ... shown into the chamber. Col. Krill straightened himself and looked around.

How long had he been there? Who had spirited away the bodies of the dead, of his men and the dead ... or undead ... cult supplicants. What had happed here? Did he and and his men fight a battle here against dead men raised by some dark gods?

“Tommy rot!” he said as he stepped towards the entrance. He kicked something on the floor. Looking down, he saw a small idol. A statue of an elempant. Solid gold. He stooped, nearly losing his balance, and picked it up. 

It was small, fitting in the palm of his hand. But heavy. Definitely solid gold, with ruby eyes. Something had broken off; a rider perhaps. Col. Krill grunted and stuffed it into his satchel.

Then he screamed and clutched his chest. The searing pain ripped through him, like a hundred arrows piercing his chest. He was knocked to his knees, his back arched as what felt like a lightning bolt shot through him from the darkness above.

His face was wet with sweat as the lightning bolt ripped through him again. Then again. Like a fist, it knocked him backwards and pinned him to the cold, stone floor.

That is when it emerged. A force, a dark and evil force seemed to explode from his chest like a sea creature trying to free itself from the surface of the sea. It was pulled back into his chest before trying to leap out again. Each time, Col. Krill screamed for it felt like whatever was inside him was breaking through his ribcage.

Then, the pain was gone. As swiftly as it had attacked him, it was gone. He lay on the stone floor panting like a dog. In front of him, towards the entrance, he heard feet shuffling.

He rolled to his side and forced open his eyes. All he saw was a pare of bare feet. Brown, dirty. The edge of a robe, pure white. He looked up and saw the Mobedan Mobed standing before him.

“You dared enter the sacred temple of the Amesha Spentas and murder its priests. Your sacrilege has opened the gateway to the realm of nightmares where my masters slumber. But no more. They have seen your sacrilege and are awakening. You are their gateway into this realm and will serve them for all time. You will bear a daily penance as the ‘gods who are rejected’ awaken and seek entrance into this realm. You are their vessel. You are their slave and have brought about eternal darkness and death to those who have rejected them.”

“My men ... what ...”

“Your men have been sacrificed to the Amesha Spentas as their food. They have slumbered for thousands of years and need sustinance as they awake and regain their strength before fully emerging and destroying the ahuras and their mazdayana. When they are ready, you will be the gateway, the vessel through which they come.”

“Like hell, you devil. I will never let these demons come. I will die before I let any damned demons use me ...”

“You have no choice.”

“I will die first ...”

“You cannot die. You belong to them and will serve your new masters well.”

Col. Krill, finding his sword laying nearby mustered all of his strength and slashed at the high priest, but his sword merely passed through the incoporeal form and was met by laughter.

“You are cursed to walk this earth alone for all eterninty until the ‘gods who are rejected’ choose to come forth. Then, and only then, can you die.”

With an echoing laughter and a hot wind, the Mobedan Mobed’s form swirled away into the mist gathered against the high stone ceiling of the temple’s inner sanctum. Once again, Col. Krill was alone in the darkness and the silence.

“Oh, god. What have I done?”

THE END
