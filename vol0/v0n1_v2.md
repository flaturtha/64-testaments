# THE GODS WHO ARE REJECTED
## THE 64 TESTAMENTS OF COLONEL KRILL --- Vol. 0, No. 1

INDIA --- 1901

A lone British soldier crouched beside the stone entrance of the great temple and eased his head around the edge of the great pillars that flanked the gaping hole that led deeper into the unknown temple. He wiped his brow on his once crisp red jacket sleeve but only managed to smear the dirt and sweat. 

Seeing nothing in the darkness, he crept forward on his knees. The well-worn floor was smooth, like polished marble, and the soldier’s hand slipped as the sweat on his palms made purchase on the floor nearly impossible. Still, he crept forward by inches.

A wind, hot and dry, blew into the massive entrance like a great beast inhaling and the soldier shuddered. He glanced back over his shoulder and could just make out his troop on the edge of the dark jungle, hidden among the trees and heavy underbrush. Only Colonel Krill stood in the open, his bright red jacket almost shining in the moonlight.

The soldier could feel his commander’s glare and turned once more to his mission.

Deeper into the darkness, he crawled. At first, the only sound was his own shuffling across the stone floor. His Lee Enfield mk3 rasped across the uneven stone floor as he dragged it with him. And the sound of his own breathing.

At the end of the short hallway that formed the entrance to the great stone temple deep in the Indian jungle, there was another hallway crossing the first. It extended left and right. The soldier hesitated, debating which wasy to turn. Then, to the right, he could see a faint light. A flicker of a candle, perhaps. 

And with it, not a sound but a pulsating beat of air. Soft at first, barely felt. Then, as the man crawled further down the ever lightening hallway, it grew stronger. It was regular, rhythmic. Like the heartbeat of a man. 

Sounds, confused, reached his ears just as he reached the next corner and then ...

AAARARRGH!

A scream exploded from the hallway in front of him like a fist punching an opponent. It fairly knocked the soldier backwards.

It came again, louder, longer.

AAARARAGAGHHH!

The soldier backed against the far wall, away from the sound. He glanced behind him, back towards the dark entrance. The faint glow of the moonlight barely gave the great doorway outline in the darkness. 

Then he wiped the sweat from his brow again and cradled his Enfield in his arms, finger on the trigger. He eased himself to his feet and stepped forward towards the sound. 

It was almost constant down, a long wail of a man in severe pain and terrible fear. 

As he crept forward, his hard soled boots clicking on the smooth stone floor, he heard, between the breaths of the screaming man, the rhythmic banging of what he now understood to be animal skin drums. At least he hoped they were skinned with animals.

Other voiced joined the drums, calling in some unknown tongue. The voiced rose and fell in regular rhythm. A pray or ceremonial chant.

The soldier found himself on a high step, an alcove above a large room. A short wall, perhaps three feet tall, stood at the lip of the alcove. He could crouch below it and peer over it. Torches burned above him on the wall, but their flickering flames were no match for the roaring fires on the floor in the main chamber.

It was risky, he knew, but it was darker where he crouched and he could peer over the short wall without being seen.

But what he saw below was more terrible than he could have imagined.

The room was massive, its floor about 20 feet below his alcove. The ceiling unseen in a mist of darkness above. Most of the floor was flat, polished rock like the hallways. Here, maybe one hundred or so dark skinned man dressed only in dirty white loincloths, knelt before a raised stone platform. Their bodied undulated as they chanted. They rose up; they sank back down. Again and again. The chant echoed off of the hard stone walls and joined the drums --- the soldier could see they were skinned with animal hides --- played by more men in white robes.

On the raised platform was a stone dias, a small alter-like ediface. On it lay a man, naked and screaming. His wail was long and mournful, like the funeral cries of professional wailers. But this sound came from the man’s soul as it cried out for mercy. Mercy that would not come.

Already, the man’s chest was flayed open and the soldier could see the still beating heart. Somehow, there was no blood except for what flowed inside.

Behind the dias stood a man but not a man. He was nearly seven feet tall, completely bald but with three white striped horizontally across his forehead with a large red dot in the center. The man, presumably the high priest, was bare chested and wore only a white lungi sarong.

In his hands, held high above his head, he held a katar dagger. Even from this distance, the soldier could see it was made of steel, but with ornate gold trim. A ceremonial knife. And it dripped with blood.

The high priest chanted in time with the supplecants below him. But his voice was deeper and carried over their shrill screams. Then, he turned and faced the giant stone statue behind him.

The enormous statue dominated the chamber, rising up so that the top of its head was lost in the mist. Its eyes, large rubies, seemed to stare directly at the soldier and he instinctively recoiled into the bare shadows of his alcove.

Then, the chanting stopped. Even the echoes ceased.

The soldier dared peer over the short stone wall again and saw the high priest prostrate before the great stone god. Smoke drifted out of its nostrils and mouth, then a flame erupted from within the monstrous stone idol and enveloped the still moaning man on the stone dias. 

As the flames consumed him, the man’s screams changed pitch, growing higher and louder. Then he was silent. Finally dead.

None of the supplicants nor the high priest moved. The only sound was the crackling of the fire and the hissing of the flesh as it burned. 

The soldier didn’t more either. His eyes were transfixed on the burning corpse.

Then the smell of burning flesh reached him and he turned and retched. Below him, the crowd of supplicants leapt to their feet with cheers of jubliation. The soldier wiped the spittle from his mouth, glanced once more at the charred remains of the man on the stone dias and ran towards the jungle outside.

At the feet of his commander, the soldier sucked down water from a canteen handed to him. He didn’t hear the voice at first.

“Dammit, man!” came the sharp voice. “Report!”

The soldier blinked and looked up. He poured the remaining water over his head and sighed.

“It was inhuman, sir.”
