THE TEMPLE BREAKER
Vol. 1, No. 1 of THE GODS WHO ARE REJECTED



Northern India --- 1901

Even in the darkness of the jungle night, the air hung with a sickly heat and echoed with the sounds of monkeys calling out to one another, bugs skittering and clacking their own calls of danger and sexual attraction.

In the distance, a sound. At first, it seemed miles away. Then it grew louder, closer. It was the sound of a rushing river, a waterfall crashing onto rocks, a foul wind ripping through the trees. The sound grew until it overcame the howls of the monkeys and the chattering of the insects. It became a scream.

The scream of a man. A man in pain, in terror.

Then silence. A silence that hung in the air, no creature daring to call out. Then it came again. A deep, moaning scream.

The scream eminated from a temple built into the jungle itself, hune from massive stones of a cliff. Inside, the shimering light of torches cast dancing shadows on the wall. The scream echoed off the hard, stone walls, then died away to be replaced by soft chants.

Inside a great room, twenty or so half naked brown skinned men in dashikies lay prostrate before a large stone dias. On top of the dias was another brown skinned man. 

He was also naked, except for the dashiki wrapped around his waist. On his head was a ragged turbin, it's furls in disarray. Sweat poured off his face and chest, which rose and fell as if searching for a sip of air.

Behind the dias stood a man over six feet tall. He wore a long, pure white robe and a turbon of his own, emblazoned with a blood red ruby rested on the forehead and seemed to burn as the torchlight reflected on it.

The high priest stood with his head back, his arms raised, a Sikh dagger in his right hand, and chanted an ancient rite.

"[INSERT ANCIENT LANGUAGE LANGUAGE]"

The chant was a mere mumble, a rumble from deep in his chest. It consumed him and his body began to shake. His mumble became louder until it echoed from the stone walls of the chamber. 

Below, the prostrate men began to undulate in rhythm with the high priest's chant. They echoed his words and began to rise: first to their knees, then squatting. Arms raised, they turned their bloodshot eyes to the dias, then man laying on it, and the high priest chanting behind it.

Drums began to pound. Cymbals rattled. The minor-key song of a sitar.

The tempo grew faster. The sound louder. It grew from a mumble and a chatter to a crushing sound that seemed to tear at the very walls of the temple.

Then, it stopped. 

Utter silence.

Behind the dias, the high priest clasped his hands together around the dagger. The man on the dias, held by some invisible hand, stared up at the glinting blade and screamed, but no sound came out of his mouth.

The high priest's eyes were closed. Then they fluttered open. He muttered a single word, then drove the dagger deep into the man's chest, dragging it downward to his stomach.

The squatting men in front of the dias leapt to their feet in a shout and the drums, cymbals, and sitar clamoured as if they had never stopped.

The high priest set the bloody dagger aside and reached into the man's chest, covering his hands with the bright red blood that oozed from the tear. With his finger, he made a small circle on the man's forehead.
